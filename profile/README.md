Twist is an alternative package ecosystem for [GNU Emacs][emacs]. It uses [the Nix package manager][nix] to build packages, to ensure reproducible builds of an Emacs configuration.

The project is experimental and unannounced yet. At present, the author, who had been a user of [straight.el][straight] for four years, uses [twist.nix][twist-nix] to build his configuration. Some other projects related to Emacs and Nix are work in progress.
